So my new app is “done”; well version 1.0.0 is. And by that I mean I just committed version 1.0.1 and fixed a minor edge case issue.

It’s odd being the person to have an idea, vet the idea to other people, build out an app and then decide that it’s something that should be out in the world. But here I am doing just that, warts and all.

I really hope this is a tool other small business owners and even general people use I hope it’s something that gets enough usage that I can afford to do ongoing development because it is something that I have lots of ideas for (TouchID, I am looking at you).
