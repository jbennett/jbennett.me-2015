I guess one of the best ways to get started with 2015 is to launch a new app. Bottom Line went live today. It’s an easy to use income tracker to help you get a 10,000 foot view of your small business’ financial state, especially income tax owed and sales tax collected.

A few of the tech details of the app are:

* written in Swift
* uses two embedded frameworks, one for core logic, one for UI elements
* has most of the hooks needed for a Today widget and an ᴡᴀᴛᴄʜ extension
* includes about 4,500 lines of code

I’m currently looking at ideas for version 1.0.2: bug fixes, Touch ID and datasets.
