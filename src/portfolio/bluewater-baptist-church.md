Bluewater Baptist Church’s website was originally built on Joomla 1.5. The site was upgraded to Drupal to help meet several needs of the website administrators. They wanted to be able to edit content easier, integrate podcasts and videos into the management of the site and allow more of the page construction to be done dynamically. There was also a great need to make the site work better on mobile devices.

When migrating to Drupal, special attention was paid to the media management backend. To add new entries to their online sermon list, the files needed to be uploaded, a text file with their meta information had to be updated and the podcast RSS feed needed to be updated. This clearly was an extensive, error prone process. With the switch to Drupal, adding a new sermon is done on one page using simple text fields. No manual uploading or editing of configuration files is required. As an added benefit, with this information being consolidated to one spot, we are able to use these files throughout the site, for example including a “most recent sermon” block on the homepage which allows the user to access the sermon and play it in their browser without needing to search for it.
