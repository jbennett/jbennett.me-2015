Sarnia Gives is a local volunteer opportunity resource. It allows not-for-profit organizations to list their volunteer needs in a simple and intuitive way. Since most local non-for-profit organizations are present on the site, this gives local volunteers a one stop location to find a volunteer opportunity that is perfectly suited to them.

Sarnia Gives is built with Joomla! and Nooku. All custom features were built into the standard administrative workflow allowing administrators to have simple and consistent management of opportunities, organizations and users. The site also integrates with several external service providers which allow organizations to renew their memberships on site and Google maps to provide relevant location information to users.
