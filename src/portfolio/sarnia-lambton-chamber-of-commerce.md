The Sarnia Lambton Chamber of Commerce is a resource for local businesses and residents, letting them know about events, information about local businesses and what resources are available to businesses.

The new Sarnia Lambton Chamber of Commerce site is built on Joomla!. All existing content was migrated to the new site and was updated to improve its layout and overall quality. I was responsible for creating the backend systems to manage their existing system and ensure that everything was well presented and logically grouped together. I also did the front end development, bringing to life the design of the site.
